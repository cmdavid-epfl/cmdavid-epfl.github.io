	      Part 1. The Big Picture.
	   </h3>
	   <br>
	   The map below illustrates the locations of everyone whom was listed as an inventor in a patent whose application was filed in 2013. It does not come as much of a surprise that inventors are spread out quite unevenly around the world, with a noteworthy sparsity in developping regions like Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia, but also quite a few high-density centers. Among the latter are the usual suspects : in the United-States, Southern California and the North-East Coast have among the highest concentration of inventors in the world. In Europe, Germany seems to be leading the pack while in Asia, that role is taken on by Japan.

   	   If you zoom in the map on North America, you'll notice that while on the US West Coast, inventors are packed very densily around a few cities - namely, Seattle and San Jos√©-San Francisco - it's a completely different story across the Atlantic : high numbers of inventors seem to be spread somewhat evenly across all of Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, The United Kingdom, and across many other European cities. In Asia, the contrast is even more stark between Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan on one hand, and China, where only Shanghai and Hong Kong have any significant concentration of inventors, on the other.

   	      A Historical Perspective : 1990-2016
   	   </h4>
   	   
   	   While these disparities may seem massive, looking at historical data, from 1990 until 2016, offers a different perspective. This next map pictures the same frame as above, but illustrates the evolution of the density of inventors on this timeline as a timelapse. It should be noted that the chronology illustrated in this following graphs, as well as in all the other graphs in this article, is based on the dates at which the patent applications were filed, instead of the dates at which the patents were granted. The reasoning behind this choice is that at the time of the patent application, the innovation supporting it already exists, and what we want to paint here is a picture of innovation. This does however have as a consequence that after 2013, we obverse a rapidly diminishing number of patents and inventors. This is due to the long delays that can exist between the moment of filing a patent application and obtaining it, a delay of often a few years, and the fact that the PatentsView database only incorporates patents once they have been formally accepted.

   What is perharps not so obvious when looking at the timelapse on this scale is the particular dynamics of the evolution of the distribution of inventors in different regions of the world. To better discern what is going on in Asia, Europe, and North America during this timeframe, we take a look at the maps which follow.

   <div class="story-text">
   Most notably in South Korea and in Taiwan, at the turn of the new millenium, the number of innovators grows from a moderate size up to the same scale as Tokyo, Japan.

   {% include image.html file="/assets/Europe_All.gif" title="Zoom on Europe." caption="Timelapse of the distribution of inventors in Europe for the period 1990-2016."%}
   
   <div class="story-text">
   What is most striking about Europe is that the region does not exhibit any significant change during the period in question. Some places - namely Paris and Munich - do seem to grow faster than other European countries but in general inventors remain mostly spread out accross the continent.

   {% include image.html file="/assets/US_All.gif" title="Zoom on the US." caption="Timelapse of the distribution of inventors in the US for the period 1990-2016."%}
   
   <div class="story-text">
   As for the US, while at the start of the 1990's, the distribution of innovators closely resembles that of Europe - with the notable exception of the Mountain States - from 2000 onwards the density of inventors in a number of cities grow remarkably : New York, Boston, Austin, Houston, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, to name a few.

      A Quantitative Perspective
   </h4>
   While these maps paint vivid picture of how innovation has evolved throught time in different places, we take a look at the numbers behind these maps before being drawing definitive conclusions.
